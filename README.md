## Dataset

To explore our research questions, we designed an exploratory scenario, Whoâ€™s the Spy, for human-robot interactions.

This game involves three players in a group. In every game round, each player is given a card with a word on it. The Spy has a different word card. The players take turns to describe the word and the robot approaches to join the group to identify the spy.

## Experimental Conditions

1. Group type: a) static b) quasi-dynamic [1]
2. Approaching Direction
3. Camera viewpoints: a) egocentric view b) perspective view

## Methods
1. WoZ
In the WoZ (Wizard-of-Oz) approach, the robot is teleoperated by a human operator (a researcher who is a trained operator).


2. Procedural Model
We use the social-aware navigation method as a procedural model to generate approaching group trajectories


3. Imitation Learning Model
We generate approaching group trajectories use a Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) framework with a Group Behavior Recognition framework.
